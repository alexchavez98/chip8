# 🎮 CHIP-8 Emulator

A CHIP-8 emulator written in **C** using **SDL2**, capable of running classic ROMs from the 1970s and 1980s. This is a personal project to learn more about virtual machines, low-level emulation, and graphics rendering.

> ⚠️ Project still in progress – sound support is not yet implemented.
